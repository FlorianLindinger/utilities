add to submenu the setting to change colors

add timestamps button and or setting. maybe add just all to a setting  submenu. also the script os no acciendtal open. alllow for "allow minimize button". make submenu stuff pinable to top bar

# addd scrollbar when too many lines

#now again resize from top does not work; now maximizing over taskbar is again wrong. was broken by attempt to undid last changes becaseu they broke remembering position beofre snap; 

# make it also not go to far ontop like bottom

#Option to open logged file for crash

#Option to print to file parallel and link to that file

#Stop python crash and print and give options to restart? Open windows prompt for crash


# mkae option to remove or add timestaps to all orints. make it removeber timesatap eve n if not tunred on
