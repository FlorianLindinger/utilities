######################

combine from pyboson and here all pyqt5 stuff

make a reset option in q classes and reset all childs that are q classes. maybe find them via new mother class 

have to define function to turn dummy off->stop connection.  Alos for turning on
never safe to turn off during main loop

same for change in com. generally for random stop connection? make it global bool and make the main loop stop and start

maybe need on_change, on_off, on_on functions with strings and lists for mulitple options. if not button spam could make problems

for dummy_checkbox: on change->reset = True,state = state
I guess just give up and define function
